        Hello! My name is Miriam Call and I am from Rexburg Idaho. I am a mom of
        a sweet 6 month old girl. She is just starting too eat solid foods. Her
        most recent favorite is banana. She is such a joy in our little family.
        Being a mom has been something I have grown to love. I also love crafts,
        cooking, and holidays. My favorite holiday is Christmas. My sweet
        husband lets me get the decorations I wish and then lets me decorate our
        home for any holiday I feel is important. He even has given me Christmas
        dishes for the Christmas season. Most recently in my life I have been
        learning to code which has been a fun adventure. It is nothing like I
        expected but I love it. It has helped me understand a lot more of how
        things in the world work when it comes to technology. I also feel that I
        have better conversatinos with my husband. He loves to code and was
        excited I have been learning. It has been a fun thing for us to work on
        together. I love life and all there is to experiance in it. I feel so
        blessed to be in the places I am now with a bright future ahead where I
        can make dreams come true.
